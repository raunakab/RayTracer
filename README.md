# My Very First Ray-Tracer!
This implementation is based off of the "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" text by Peter Shirley.
However, I do include my personal modifications and twists to the original implementation, because that's the only way you learn.

# File Structure

	root
		|_ out
			|_ ...
		|_ src
			|_ main.cpp
			|_ vec3
				|_ vec3.h
				|_ vec3.cpp
		|_ make

All computational outputs are redirected to the out directory, where they are stored as .ppm files.
